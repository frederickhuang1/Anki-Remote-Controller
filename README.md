Medical knowledge has been growing at skyrocketing paces with new advances in science. Doubling time for medical information is considered to be around 73 days. With a growing plethora of preclinical information needed to be understood by students, implementation of resources in preparation of USMLE certification has led students within medical school and beyond to adopt the use of Anki as a flashcard software. This spaces information review over periods of time for student to retain greater amounts of knowledge over longer time.

Students have been adopting the use of remote controllers such as the 8bitdo Zero 2 to be able to use this software while even away from their computers. What started as joke became a project to understand the underlying mechanisms driving these devices, ranging from power regulation to RF communications and their applications to relaying information in the digital age.

With where the project stands at the moment, further developments will include the introduction features such as a MOSFET for latching circuits to turn buttons into a electronic switch that can regulate wireless connection while being sustained by external power. Wireless power transfer methods will also be explored to charge a battery running this device.
